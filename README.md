# Neural-Network-with-no-library-used

This a self built neural network that performs digits recognition over handwritten digits. <br>
It uses no machine learning or computer vision library like OpenCV or Tensorflow. <br>
Even the basic functions like grayscale are performed using **NTSC Formula** instead of using openCV.
